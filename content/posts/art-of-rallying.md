## What is The Mongol Rally?
The Mongol Rally is an intercontinental car rally that begins in Europe and ends in Ulan-Ude, Russia. The rally originally ended in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. However, to avoid punitive costs and taxes associated with vehicle imports and disposal, the rally now passes through Mongolia and ends in Ulan-Ude.

## What should I know before I participate?
If you want to participate in the Mongolian Car Rally, you might need to know the  preparations for rallying, the dangers of rallying and the benefits that come from  it. 

## How do I get started?
Well firstly you must go to the place where the event is held. You must transport  your car without it getting damaged. You also need a place to stay. The most important thing is that you must know your race track, one wrong turn and will be  lost in the massive country. It is also necessary to pack up with food, water,  camping gear, maps and compass. 

## Bonus points to know
You will need to have perfect harmony with your car. It’s not about going fast it’s  about getting there safely. There are dangerous animals like snakes and scorpions. The landscape is unforgiving, there could be tall dunes, sandstorms and  the blistering hot sun. There are disadvantages and advantages of racing during  day or night. 
But for me the benefits out way the dangers. When you find that perfect bit of  road there is no one to stop you from speeding and getting to see the wonderful  scenery having an adventure with maybe a friend. The feeling of accomplishment .when you reach the end of the race is something different.
