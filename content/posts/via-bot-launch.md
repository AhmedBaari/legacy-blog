## The history behind Via Bot

The Via Bot was originally developed on June 2021 by Ahmed Baari and was used as a utility tool in a few small, private servers. A few months later, Baari worked with Aaren to giving it a full upgrade, make it more user friendly and also added a few more features. The new version was then launched on September 2021 and has been used in over 100 servers. Thus, it got verified by Discord and was given the "Verified Bot" badge.

Soon, it's features were outdated but we weren't able to update it back then. However, we got back into the development of Via Bot in August 2022 and we are now proud to announce that the new version of Via Bot is now live!

## Via Bot In A Nutshell

Via is a discord bot that gives roles to actively texting members, members in voice channels and members with a custom status that supports the server.

For example, when a member sends a message in your server, they get the active role, say, @Active. They have it as long as they continue texting in your server. The bot removes the role after a certain amount of time after their last message.

Here's another example. You have a server called Wumpus World. You want to give the @Supporters role to members who have a custom status of .gg/wumpus. Via Bot's loyal roles feature can do this for you!

## The Developers

The Via Bot was developed by Ahmed Baari, an 18 year old developer who just graduated from high school. He is a self taught developer who has been developing discord bots for over a year now. He is also the founder of The Baari Blog. 

The website was developed by Aayush Rajagopalan, a 15 year old student who is currently in high school. He is a self taught cloud engineer and web developer who has been developing with Baari for over a year. He is also hosting the Via Bot's servers.
